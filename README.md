# Decentralized AI Computation Network (DAICN)

## 🌐 Project Vision

DAICN is a revolutionary blockchain-powered platform that democratizes AI computational resources through a distributed, tokenized marketplace.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Current AI computing landscape is:
- Centralized around big cloud providers
- Expensive for small teams and researchers
- Limited by geographical and financial constraints
- Lacks transparency and fair resource allocation

## 💡 Our Solution

DAICN creates a peer-to-peer network where:
- Anyone can contribute computational resources
- AI tasks are efficiently distributed
- Providers earn tokens for their computing power
- Clients access affordable, scalable AI infrastructure

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Decentralized Compute Marketplace
- Peer-to-peer GPU/CPU resource sharing
- Transparent task allocation
- Fair compensation mechanism

### 2. Tokenized Incentive System
- Earn tokens by providing computational resources
- Pay for AI tasks using network tokens
- Transparent and low-cost transactions

### 3. Advanced Network Monitoring
- Real-time dashboard tracking network health
- Comprehensive metrics visualization
- Reputation and performance tracking

## 🛠 Technical Architecture
